[!] App requires Multidex support
Multidex support is required for your android app to build since the number of methods has exceeded 64k. See https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment/android#enabling-multidex-support for more information. You may pass the --no-multidex flag to skip Flutter's multidex support to use a manual solution.

    Flutter tool can add multidex support. The following file will be added by flutter:

SOLUTION: Run this command `fvm flutter run --multidex`




fvm flutter pub run flutter_native_splash:create
